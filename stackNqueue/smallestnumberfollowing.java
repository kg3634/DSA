/*1. You are given a pattern of upto 8 length containing characters 'i' and 'd'. 2. 'd' stands for 
decreasing and 'i' stands for increasing 3. You have to print the smallest number, using the digits 
1 to 9 only without repetition, such that the digit decreases following a d and increases follwing 
an i. e.g. d -> 21 i -> 12 ddd -> 4321 iii -> 1234 dddiddd -> 43218765 iiddd -> 126543
