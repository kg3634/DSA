Consider an array:

array = [1,2,3,4]

Subarray : [1,2],[1,2,3] - is continous and maintains relative order of elements

Subsequence: [1,2,4] - is not continous but maintains relative order of elements

Subset: [1,3,2] - is not continous and does not maintain relative order of elements

Some interesting observations :

Every Subarray is a Subsequence.
Every Subsequence is a Subset.
